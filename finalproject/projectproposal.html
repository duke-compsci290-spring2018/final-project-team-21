            <p>We would like to create an application to help people discover and keep track of different non-profit organizations and charities.</p>
            <P>We plan on using the weather API and calculating the golden hour based on sunrise and sunset.</P>
            <p>The user will be able to input the direction of the light, input how bright the light (on a scale), and indicate which area has shade. The application will then generate tips on where to stand and what to set the aperture and shutter speed to.</p>
