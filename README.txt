README: Charitability Final Project

1. Chengrui Fu and Michelle Li. Our Net ID?s are cf179 and mjl74.
2. We started the assignment on 04/21/2018 and ended on 04/29/2018. The project took me about 120 hours to finish.
3. We spoke with a few of the TAs on the assignment including Robyn Kwok.
4. We used Stack Overflow, Vue.js documents, Vuex documentation, Charity Navigator API documentation, Vue-Router documentation, and W3Schools to complete the project.
5. We used CSS that was created by the Vue webpack simple command. We also want to give credit for Charity Navigator for allowing us to use their API. We also used W3Schools for creating a modal.
6. There are no more bugs or concerns for our website.
7. There are no extra credit features on our website. 



what makes your application useful:

	Our application is extremely useful for people that want to donate to a Charity or have money to donate to a charity but do not know which charity to donate to or the available charities that are out there. Our website allows users to create a profile in which they are able to set a goal for how much they want to donate and also a profile picture which they can change. From this, they are able to view a list of all the charities, featured charities, and top charities. From this display of data, they can determine what charities they want to donate to. Each charity option also gives the user more information about the charity by allowing the user to go to the Charity Navigator website for the charity or the charity website itself. The user can then donate through the charity website and write a review for the charity. A unique aspect about our charity website is that it allows users to write reviews for charities depending on what they heard about the charity. Other users can then look at these reviews. Our website essentially connects users to charities more easily and gives users a simple way to determine what charities to donate to. 
	Furthermore, we have an admin which can monitor the number of users and the donations for each of the users. Regular people can also browse the site without making a profile page. However, they will only be able to view the home page for the website which only tells them the featured charities and the top charities. Lastly, our application will be useful because more people can now easily have access to donate to these charities.


special instructions needed to set up, run, access, or use your application (like user passwords you have set up, command line utilities, or external programs that need to be run):

	The only special instructions for the website include the admin login username and password. The admin username is admin@admin.com and the password is iamadmin.


references for your data that establishes its authenticity:
	
	Our data is taken from Charity Navigator which is a reputable source for charity information.



discuss both the pros and the cons of different framework possibilities you considered and why you made the decision you did (including choosingÿnotÿto use any framework):

	When we first started creating the web application, we decided that Vue would be the best framework. We decided to use Vue because both of us worked with different technologies in the Explore project and we felt that we had the most experience working with Vue. We wanted to take our Vue knowledge to the next level. We didn?t use react because although it was popular, we did not have enough experience with it. This also goes with Angular in which neither of us worked with before. After starting to use Vue, we decided to use Node.JS because it would be an easy way to incorporate Vue-Router and Vuex. We decided to use these two technologies because Vuex made it easy to have a central storage of all of the information. Furthermore, we used Vue-Router because we had a lot of links and wanted each of the pages to be different from each other. The pros on using Vue include that it is easy to navigate and we have the most experience with. The cons include the fact that Vue is still not widely used so there might not be enough documentation. The pros of React and Angular is that they are both more widely used and have more documentation for online. However, the cons of using them include the fact that we did not have enough experience working with them. After weighing the pros and cons, we decided that we should use Vue.JS as the main framework for the website.
